![Test Image 8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tograh/testrepository/master/3DTest.png 334)# refactoring-hw-html-css
I took code from an existing website for a company and refactored it.
I combined multiple class ids in my css style sheet that had the same rules to consolidate and make it easier to read.
I fixed a broken internal link in the header that was missing a id.
I changed the header and footer tags to just header and footer and took out the class for better accesability.
I also added comments into each change that I meade in the code so that it is easy to see what has been changed.
The link to my finsihed site is https://akays89.github.io/refactoring-hw-html-css/.
